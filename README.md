Every now and then, disasters and emergencies could happen and while people may do their best to prepare for it, something unexpected can always arise, and 
during this time, it is crucial to receive the necessary help quickly. The rise of internet and social media has made communication easy, but manual 
processing of emergencies and requests for help is still time-consuming, as understanding the situation and the needs of the person in distress may not be 
so straightforward. This project aims to solve this problem by building an end-to-end pipeline to classify emergency messages.

The main tools used in this project include Python, Spark, Airflow, and AWS.
